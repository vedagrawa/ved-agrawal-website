I have taken classes such as Data Mining and Machine Learning, Calculus for Business, Corporate Finance, and Financial Management.</p>\n",
    "            <p>My interests lie in machine learning, data analytics, and private equity. I have expertise in predictive modeling, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms using tools like Python and SQL. I have worked on projects involving large-scale data processing, statistical analysis, and financial modeling.</p>\n",
    "            <p>Specifically, I have worked on projects such as predicting optimal playtime for NBA players, analyzing the Boston Marathon, and analyzing Boston crime around college campuses. I have also developed a strong foundation in investment strategies and private equity evaluation.</p>\n",
    "            <p>Through this intersection, I have understood how businesses can make data-driven decisions. I believe I bring a unique perspective because I understand multiple perspectives of a business. Overall, I have a strong commitment to gain hands-on experience through internships or co-op programs to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.</p>\n",
    "            <p>I would be interested in collaborating with industry professionals, and continue expanding my knowledge in data science and finance. I am always open to networking and learning from others in the field.</p>\n",

Data science and finance let me merge analytical thinking with real-world applications, helping companies and individuals create informed decisions. My passion for data science comes from my ability to find the pattern, adapt processes and improve innovation.</p>\n",

    "            <p>I like the challenge of finding new techniques, discovering innovative approaches, and implementing my skills to increase innovation. I am also interested in how Artificial Intelligence will affect these fields. Both these fields will be heavily automated going forward, so I am interested in seeing how these fields progress.</p>\n",
